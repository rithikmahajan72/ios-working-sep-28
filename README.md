# iOS Working Sep 28 - Yoraa React Native App

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project with Redux store integration, API services, and comprehensive iOS/Android build support.

## Features
- Redux state management with multiple slices (auth, cart, favorites, notifications, etc.)
- API integration with interceptors and error handling
- Comprehensive build scripts for iOS and Android production
- Firebase integration for authentication and phone verification
- Apple Sign In and Google Sign In support

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 4: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.js` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Project Structure

This project includes:
- `src/store/` - Redux store configuration with slices for different app features
- `src/api/` - API client configuration and services
- `src/components/` - React Native components including Redux examples
- `src/providers/` - Context providers including Redux provider
- `md/` - Documentation and setup guides
- `sh files/` - Build and deployment scripts

## Redux Store Features

The app includes several Redux slices:
- **authSlice** - User authentication state
- **cartSlice** - Shopping cart management
- **favoritesSlice** - User favorites
- **notificationSlice** - Push notifications
- **orderSlice** - Order management
- **productSlice** - Product catalog
- **uiSlice** - UI state management
- **userSlice** - User profile data

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
