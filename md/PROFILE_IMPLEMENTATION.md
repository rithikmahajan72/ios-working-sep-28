## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/
├── profile.js (Main profile screen component)
└── components/
    └── layout.js (Updated to use ProfileScreen)
```

### Key Components
- `ProfileScreen`: Main component exported for use in navigation
- `ProfileHeader`: User info and profile picture section
- `MenuSection`: Reusable section container
- `MenuItem`: Individual menu item with icon, text, and optional right component

### Styling
- **Color Scheme**: Matches YORAA brand colors (#FF6B6B primary)
- **Design**: Modern card-based layout with shadows
- **Typography**: Consistent font weights and sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Touch feedback and proper spacing

### Integration
- Successfully integrated with existing bottom navigation
- Replaced placeholder ProfileContent with full ProfileScreen
- Maintains app's navigation flow and styling consistency

## Usage
Users can access the profile page by tapping the "Profile" tab in the bottom navigation. The page provides complete account management functionality with a polished, professional interface that matches the YORAA fashion app's design language.

## Next Steps
- Connect to actual user data (currently uses mock data)
- Implement actual navigation to sub-pages (Order History, Settings, etc.)
- Add user authentication integration
- Implement dark mode theme switching
- Add profile image upload functionality

The profile page is now fully functional and ready for user testing and further development.
