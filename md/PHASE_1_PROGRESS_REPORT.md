2. Add error boundaries for critical screens
3. Fix component definition issues in other files

### **Medium Priority:**
4. Add comprehensive accessibility to all TouchableOpacity elements
5. Implement performance optimizations across all screens
6. Standardize navigation patterns

### **Low Priority:**
7. Add TypeScript or PropTypes for better type safety
8. Implement consistent coding patterns

## **Next Phase Plan:**

### **Phase 2: Error Handling & User Experience**
1. Add try-catch blocks to all async operations
2. Replace console.log error reporting with user-friendly Alert messages  
3. Add loading states for better UX
4. Implement proper form validation

### **Phase 3: Accessibility Enhancement**

### **Phase 4: Performance Optimization** 
1. Add useCallback to all event handlers
2. Implement useMemo for computed values
3. Add React.memo to frequently re-rendering components
4. Replace ScrollView with FlatList for large lists

The app is now in a much more stable state with production-ready logging practices and initial performance improvements!
